Fuel Filter Views
===================

This little add-on lets you create new FuelPHP View Filters that process the strings generated by a rendered View.


No Follow Filter
====================

Included in the code is a sample No Follow Filter.  This filter injects rel="nofollow" into html links.

Usage:

```php
	// create a new view (these extend FuelPHP's View Class)
	$view = \Filter\View::forge('myView');
	$view->add_filters(\Filter\NoFollow::forge());
	echo($view);
```

Creating Custom Filters
========================

Create a new Filter class that extends our Filter class. 

For example: this class named /fuel/app/classes/reversefilter.php

```php
<?
namespace \Filter;

class ReverseFilter extends Filter
{
	public static function process($string)
	{
		return strrev($string);
	}
}
```

Usage:

```php
	// create a new view (these extend FuelPHP's View Class)
	$view = \Filter\View::forge('myView');
	$view->add_filters(ReverseFilter::forge());
	echo($view);
```

Installation
